    BMI Imperial Lab:

    Body mass index (BMI) is a number calculated from a personâ€™s weight and height.
    According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the BMI is a fairly reliable indicator of body fatness for
    most people. BMI does not measure body fat directly, but research has shown that BMI correlates to direct measures of
    body fat, such as underwater weighing and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The formula for BMI is weight/height2 where
    weight is in kilograms and height is in meters.

    Write a program that prompts for weight in pounds and height in inches, converts the values to metric, and then
    calculates the BMI with two decimal places.

    Note: 1 pound is 0.453592 kilograms and 1 inch is 0.0254 meters.


    For example, an execution could look like this:

    Please enter weight in pounds: 135
    Please enter height in inches: 71
    BMI is: 18.83

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    double weight, height, bmi;
    cout << "Please enter weight in pounds: "; cin >> weight;
    cout << "Please enter height in inches: "; cin >> height;

    weight *= 0.453592;
    height *= 0.0254;

    bmi = weight / (height * height);
    cout << "BMI is: " << fixed << setprecision(2) << bmi << endl;

    return 0;
